        <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> has no central editorial board. Contributions are made by a
        large number of volunteers at
        their
        own
        discretion. Edits are neither the responsibility <span class="js">JavaScript</span> of the
        Wikimedia Foundation (the organisation that hosts the
        site) nor of its staff and edits will not <span>generally be made</span> in response to an email request.
        Although Wikipedia was founded by Jimmy Wales, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> he is not
        <span>personally </span>responsible for our content.
        If you have questions about the <span class="js">JavaScript</span> concept of Wikipedia rather
        than a specific problem, the About
        Wikipedia page may help. If you want to ask other users for help with editing or using Wikipedia, stop by the
        Teahouse, Wikipedia's live
        help channel, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> or the help desk to ask someone for assistance.
